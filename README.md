## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Web-first workflow


### What I learned

In this Challabge i solidified my flexbox and grid. i found that if i place each section of code in a solid border i'm able to align the code within their respective element without worrying about overflow that much.


### Continued development


In this challange i struggled with aligning  individual items within a grid column though i was able to find a way, this area needs further development. 
second isssue i had was to use the svg as backgrounds and i continue to struggle with that.
Futher research will be done on svgs and background images.

### Useful resources

- [FLEXBOX FROGGY](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - Used thsi amazing website to relearn flexbox multiple times.

- [Grid Layout Box Alignment ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Box_Alignment_in_CSS_Grid_Layout) - Had to reread this page to reunderstand flexbox
